   The <b>Simple Attendance</b> system is developed to use Google Forms
   to have students use their devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc) to 
   connect to an URL that opens a Google Form and to record their presence in 
   a class (lecture, laboratory, etc) session, and for the instructor to take
   that data and check it against a roster, with the output to the instructor 
   of which students are <em>absent</em> and <em>present</em> in the session.
</p>
<p>A web app (written in TypeScript) was coded to take the input files needed
   and to present the results both on web page and for download as a CSV file.

<p>
The form designer (the instructor) will edit a Google Form like the one below</p>
